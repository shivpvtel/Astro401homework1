#Questions:# Consider two bodies of mass m1 and m2 separated by a distance d traveling in circular orbits around their mutual center of mass. Take the angular momentum vector of the system to be pointing in the +z direction. In a frame that co-rotates with the orbital motion there are five locations (called the Lagrange points) where the effective acceleration felt by a test particle vanishes. The acceleration arises from the gravity due to m1 and m2 plus the rotation of the system as a whole. If the masses are at points x1 < x2 on the x axis (sod=x2−x1),thenbyconventionL3 <x1 <L1 <x2 <L2. TheL4 andL5 pointslie off the x axis and form equilateral triangles with the points x1 and x2. Conventionally, L4 is taken to be in the +y direction, L5 in the −y direction.
